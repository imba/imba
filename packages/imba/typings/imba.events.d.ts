    /**
     [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) is a [well-supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver) API in modern browsers. It provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport. Imba adds a simplified abstraction on top of this via the custom `@intersect` event.

    #### Syntax

    ```imba
    # Will only trigger when intersection ratio increases
    <div @intersect.in=handler>
    # Will only trigger when element is more than 50% visible
    <div @intersect(0.5).in=handler>
    ```

    #### Parameters

    The `@intersect` events accepts several arguments. You can pass in an object with the same [root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/root), [rootMargin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin), and [threshold](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/threshold)  properties supported by [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver).

    ```imba
    <div @intersect=handler> # default options
    <div @intersect(root: frame, rootMargin: '20px')=handler>
    <div @intersect(threshold: [0,0.5,1])=handler>
    ```

    For convenience, imba will convert certain arguments into options. A single number between 0 and 1 will map to the [threshold](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/threshold) option:
    ```imba
    # n 0-1 adds single threshold at n visibility
    <div @intersect(0)=handler> # {threshold: 0}
    <div @intersect(0.5)=handler> # {threshold: 0.5}
    <div @intersect(1)=handler> # {threshold: 1.0}
    ```
    Any number above 1 will add n thresholds, spread evenly:
    ```imba
    <div @intersect(2)=handler> # {threshold: [0,1]}
    <div @intersect(3)=handler> # {threshold: [0,0.5,1]}
    <div @intersect(5)=handler> # {threshold: [0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1]}
    # ... and so forth
    ```
    An element will map to the [root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/root) option:
    ```imba
    <div @intersect(frame)=handler> # {root: frame}
    <div @intersect(frame,3)=handler> # {root: frame, threshold: [0,0.5,1]}
    ```
    A string will map to the [rootMargin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin) option:
    ```imba
