# Changelog

## Unreleased

Last version (with new features) before `beta.1`. This release contains breaking changes in the bundler that need to be tested thoroughly before beta.

* Use the latest version of esbuild

    We are finally using the latest version of esbuild. All of our custom logic
    for hashing, resolving and chunking is now done by esbuild instead.

* Support path aliases from `[js|ts]config.json`

    Now that we are using the latest version of esbuild we finally support [path aliases](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping) declared in `[js|ts]config.json` files. This also works with assets, ie. declaring `"icons/*": ["assets/svg/*","assets/codicons/*]` in your tsconfig would allow `<svg src="icons/some-icon.svg">` to work anywhere in your project.

* Remove support for path aliases in `imbaconfig.json`

    If you had declared path aliases in an `imbaconfig.json` these should be moved into a `[js|ts]config.json` instead.

* Remove backwards compatible transforms from compiler itself.

    Previously we included a bunch of logic for transforming conditional assignments like `??=`,`&&=`, and `||=` to support older browsers and node versions. Now we compile these statements as is and rely on esbuild to transform when needed.

* Remove support for `?=` operator - use `??=` instead.

* Drop commonjs target from compiler

    The imba compiler will now always compile import/export statements natively
    to import/export in javascript, and instead rely on esbuild to convert the output to cjs when needed.

* Simplify output from `imba build`

    The output of imba build is now possible to run directly through node (and soon Bun). We 

* Allow running html file directly with `imba some-entry.html`

    This will spawn a dev-server for this html file and its referenced scripts and stylesheets.

* Allow testing client-side scripts with `imba --web some-entry.imba`

    This will spawn a dev-server, a html entrypoint and all that is needed to run a script in the browser.

* Copy static assets over from `public` when building

    If you have a `public` directory in your project, files from this will be copied over to the public folder of your output dir (default `dist`) when building.

* Allow prefixing asset paths via `--base` option

    Ie, when building for github pages you would run `imba build --base /my-repo-name -o docs index.html` to build your files and assets with the correct prefix, into the `docs/` folder of your project to adhere to github pages convetions.

* Support loading workers following vite conventions

    ```
    import MyWorker from './some/script?worker'
    import MySharedWorker from './some/script?sharedworker'
    import url from './some/script?worker&url'
    ```

* Set node14.13.0 as the default minimum target when building for node.

    This can be overridden by supplying your version of node through the `--node.target` option. Ie `imba build --node.target node12 my/script.imba`

* Fixed regression in router that caused routed elements inside the root component to fail.

## 2.0.0-alpha.214

* Treat routes ending with `/` as exact routes.

    The `<div route='/'>` would previously match any path. You could define exact routes by including a `$` at the end of the route. This lead to a lot
    of confusion. Now, any route that ends with a `/` will only match the exact path. Use `*` to bypass

    ```imba
    <div route='/'> # matches / _only_
    <div route='/*'> # matches any path

    <div route='/items'> # matches /items, /items/1 etc
    <div route='/items/'> # matches /items only
    ```

* Only show first matching element if multiple siblings match a route.

    ```imba
    <div>
        <div route='/items/new'>
        <div route='/items/:id'> # if /items/new matched - this will not show
        <div route='/'> # matches if url is exactly '/'
        <div route='*'> # matches if none of the above matches
    ```

## 2.0.0-alpha.213

* Make `@event.emit('...')` on `<global/teleport>` dispath event inside their literal parent (fixes #693) 

## 2.0.0-alpha.210

* Add number units for `minutes`, `hours`, and `days`

* Fixed issue where identical nested selectors were incorrectly optimized away

* Support `silent: true` option for `imba.autorun` to not call imba.commit

* Fixed issue where @autorun methods threw error when element was re-mounted (#684)

## 2.0.0-alpha.209

* Fixed bug with observables not unsubscribing correctly in certain cases

* Expose `imba.reportObserved`, `imba.reportChanged` and `imba.createAtom` (still experimental)

* Add `imba.hotkeys.addKeycodes(...)` (#677)

* Made `@touch.hold(dur)=handler` trigger handler after duration without waiting for additioanl events (#664)

## 2.0.0-alpha.207

* Don't try to implicitly return debugger statement

* Improve compilation of `extend` statements for tooling

## 2.0.0-alpha.206

* Disallow iterating over falsy values using `for in`

* Compile literal bigints correctly

* Minor improvements to type definitions

## 2.0.0-alpha.205

* Support `for await ... of` syntax

* Support tagged templates

    Works like in plain js, but `{}` is still used for interpolation instead of `${}`.
    
    ```imba
        import md from 'tag-markdown'
        const html = md`## Welcome to {name}`
    ```

* Add internal `#__patch__(props)` method for class instances to update fields

* Stop shimming top-level await (delegates responsibility to esbuild)


## 2.0.0-alpha.204

* Fixed operator precedence for ternary expressions

* Revert automatic `calc` wrapping for css values introduced in alpha 200

    Introduced a lot of bugs and challenges related to `/` being a valid part of css values. `calc` will still be automatically be added around top-level parenthesis in css values, so `width:(100vw - 20px)` will still compile as `calc(100vw - 20px)`, but properties like `grid-column: 1 / 3` will now compile without calc again.

## 2.0.0-alpha.203

* Fixed regression with negated breakpoint modifiers like `display@!600:none`

## 2.0.0-alpha.202

* Fixed performance regression for tag trees introduced in alpha 191

* Fixed compilation of css properties wrapped in parenthesis

* Make unresolved decorators resolve to `imba.@decorator`

    ```imba
    class Order
        @lazy get lines
            ...
    ```

    If `@lazy` is not found in the file above, the compiler will essentially include 
    `import {@lazy} from 'imba` when compiling.

* Introduced experimental state management decorators

    A minimal set of decorators heavily inspired by MobX that allows you to mark classes 
    and objects as observable, and run code upon changes. This feature will be kept under 
    wraps until it has been battle-tested.

## 2.0.0-alpha.201

* Fixed regression where css colors `rgb(0 0 0 / alpha)` would compile incorrectly

## 2.0.0-alpha.200

* Allow `@hotkey('*')` to listen to all hotkey events

    This is perfect for disabling all other hotkeys in certain contexts.

    ```imba
    tag ConfirmDialog
        # when this dialog is mounted - all hotkey handlers preceding
        # it in the dom tree will be blocked by the `*` listener
        <self @hotkey('*').global>
            <button @hotkey('esc')> "Cancel"
            <button @hotkey('enter')> "Ok"
    ```

* Automatically wrap style expressions in `calc()`

    ```imba
    css div width: calc(100vw - 40px)
    # can now be written as
    css div width: 100vw - 40px
    ```

* Make bind=data.property work for textarea when value is `undefined`

* Allow nested parentheticals in css calc

* Fixed issue where removing class names using `el.flags.remove` would not work

* Made `@touch.flag` support selector in second argument to match `@event.flag`

* Allow second argument to `el.flags.incr(flag, dur = 0)`

    With this argument you can automatically decrement the flag after a certain duration.

* Allow negated style modifiers

    ```imba
    css div
        @!hover o:0.5 # div:not(:hover) { opacity: 0.5 } 
        @!md d:none # @media (max-width: 767px) { div { display:none } }
    # also works for classes
    css div
        @.!disabled o:0.5 # div:not(.disabled){ opacity:0.5 }
    ```

## 2.0.0-alpha.199

* Fix regression where content of `<teleport>` and `<global>` was not rendered (#643)

## 2.0.0-alpha.198

* Change how css specificity is forced in generated selectors

    Older browsers do not support complex selectors within `:not()`, so the style `:not(#_#_#_)` which is used for "inline" styles would not work in these browsers. We have now reverted to using multiple not selectors like `:not(#_):not(#_):not(#_)`. This is more verbose but the size is negligible, especially with compression. Debugging styles in the browser is a bit more clumsy.

* Change css specificity for component rules

    Selectors inside tag declarations are now compiled with a higher specificity than global selectors.

    ```imba
    tag App
        # scoped selectors have higher precedence than global styles
        css .selector d:block
    ```

* Fixed case where a generated class-name is added multiple times on elements

## 2.0.0-alpha.197

* Fixed issue with bracketless multiline object and certain operators

    ```imba
    let x = null
    x ||=
        one: 1
        two: 2
    # would previously compile incorrectly to x ||= {one: 1}
    ```

## 2.0.0-alpha.196

* Introduced `@event.closest(sel)` modifier

    Works like `@event.sel(selector)`, but checks for `target.closest(...)` instead of `target.matches(...)`.
    In the cases where you want to just handle clicks that do _not_ match a selector you can negate the modifier using `.!closest(...)`.

    ```imba
    tag App
        <self>
            # all clicks outside of button tags
            <div @click.!closest('button')>
                <button> <span> "Click"
                <p> "blabla"
    ```

## 2.0.0-alpha.195

* Fixed compilation issue for functional tags without arguments

* Throw error when trying to use bind on functional tags

## 2.0.0-alpha.194

* Improved syntax for functional tags

    If you supply `()` after a tag name, Imba will now treat it as a functional tag. Ie, `<some-name(1,2)>` is equal to `<( some-name(1,2) )>`. The old syntax may be phased out before final release. 

    ```imba
    def List items
        return if items.length == 0

        <section>
            <slot>
            <ul> for item in items
                <li> item.title

    tag App
        def head
            <header> <slot> <h2> "Welcome"

        <self>
            <head()>
            <List(data.newest)> <h2> "Newest posts"
            <List(data.all).large> <h2> "All posts"
    ```

## 2.0.0-alpha.193

* Fix issue where parts of runtime was incorrectly tree-shaked

* Always resolve `node:*` imports as external

* Include changelog.md in npm package

## 2.0.0-alpha.191

There will likely be a few more alpha releases fixing regressions and issues related to the new features in alpha 191, but after these potential issues have been resolved we're moving to beta 🥳! This release does contain a few breaking changes, both in relation to styles and memoization. We'll update the docs at imba.io and publish a screencast going over the changes to make it easier to transition to this new version. Changes;

* Rename $key to key

    To give elements a stable identity (usually inside lists) you should now use `<el key=value>` instead of `<el $key=value>`. `$key` is deprecated and will be removed in `beta.1`. 

* Allow using any object as `<element key=...>` value

    Keyed elements now use a `Map` instead of a plain object to keep track of unique elements. This means that any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as keys.

    ```imba
    const items = [{title: "One"},{title: "Two"}]

    tag App
        <self> for item in items
            # objects themselves can be used as keys now
            <AppItem key=item data=item>
    ```

* New (improved) syntax for rendering functional components / tag trees

    This was the main change holding us back from reaching beta, as it is a breaking change for most users. When you want to include external live dom elements from getters or methods outside of the render-tree, wrap the expression in `<(expression)>`.

    Besides simplifying the way memoization works it also allows you to add classes and styles to these external fragments, making it vastly more flexible than before.

    ```imba
    tag App
        get body
            <div> "This is body"

        def list title, items
            <section>
                <h2> title
                <ul> for item in items
                    <li> item.title

        <self>
            <( body )>
            <( list 'Top', data.popular ).large [mt:2]>
            <( list 'New', data.posts.slice(0,10) )>
    ```

* Log warnings to console when building/running without minification

    Added runtime checks that notify about erroneous behaviour when building/running w/o minification. Initially it will only warn about non-memoized elements being created during rendering. Eventually we'll use these conventions to add much more elobrate checks and readable error messages for the most common issues users can run into.

* Allow instantiating elements w/o memoization using `new`

    Imba will automagically allow any element (literal tag) in any method to be memoized.

    ```imba
    def wrap text
        let div = <div.item> text
        return div

    imba.mount do <section>
        <( wrap "One" )>
        <( wrap "Two" )>
    ```

    If you call a method or access a getter that returns an element (like `def wrap`) it will look up a memoization context and just reuse/update the div for that particular context. If you call it directly without being in a context, Imba will warn you. There are however some situations where you actually just want to create new elements. In this case, use `new` in front of the element. If the root is not memoized, the children won't either, so you only need to add `new` in front of the top element.

    ```imba
    def wrap text
        let div = new <div.item> text
        return div
    ```

* Allow non-global tag types in dynamic tag names

    Local tag types are now allowed in `<{tag-type} ...>` syntax. Previously it would only work when `tag-type` evaluated to a string, and there was a globally defined web component or native tag with that name. Now it works with classes as well.

    ```imba
    import {PostView,ArticleView} from './views'

    const items = [
        { type: Post, title: "My post"}
        { type: Article, title: "My article"}
    ]

    tag App
        <self>
            for item in items
                <{item.type} data=item>
    ```

* Only allow named elements inside `<self>`

    Using named elements (`<div$myname>`) outside of self would previously introduce subtle bugs and conflicts. They are now only allowed inside of `<self>`.

* Changed css specificity

    Styles declared in tag declaration body now has lower specificity than class selectors.

    ```imba
    css .warn hue:red
    css .large p:4 fs:lg

    tag Button
        css p:2 fs:sm hue:blue
    
    # styles from classes take precedence
    <Button.warn.large>
    ```

* Scoped selectors no longer applies to self

    Now, selectors like `.warn` declared in tag declaration body only applies to elements _inside_ `Button`, not the button itself. To target the button itself, use `&` in the selector.

    ```imba
    tag Button
        css bg:blue2
        css .warn bg:red2
        css &.large fs:lg

        <self.warn.large> "Still blue bg - but large"
    ```

* Add `declare` keyword for declaring fields (with type annotations) without generating any code for that field

    ```imba
    class Foo
        declare a\number
    ```

* Allow multiline conditionals when lines start with `and`,`or`,`||`, or `&&`

    This is a temporary solution for a larger challenge. It simply ignores new-lines whenever your line starts with these operators.

    ```imba
    if condition
    and test
    or force
        return ...
    ```

* Allow third argument in `for in` loops referencing length

    If you need to know the length of a collection you are iterating over, you can now access the total length of the collection by supplying a third argument. This is not available in `for of`, only `for in`.

    ```imba
    for member,index,len in list
        # len refers to the length of the iterable list
        if index == len - 1
            yes # this is the last element
    ```

* Exposed `imba.hotkeys.humanize` for converting hotkey combos to readable shortcuts

* Exposed `imba.hotkeys.htmlify` for converting hotkey combos to readable shortcuts as html


## 2.0.0-alpha.190

* Fixed regression related to implicit parenthesis in tag trees

* Renamed `@hotkey.capture` to `@hotkey.force`

## 2.0.0-alpha.189

* Introduced `@hotkey.repeat` modifier

    When a user presses a key and then keeps holding it, keydown/keypress
    events will be generated every n milliseconds. For hotkeys you usually
    only want to trigger once when the user press the combination.

    If you want the handler to keep firing while user holds down the keys
    you can now use the `.repeat` modifier:

    ```imba
    # will only toggle when pressing space, no matter how long you
    # keep it pressed.
    <div @hotkey('space')=togglePlayback>
    # holding the right arrow will call fastForward repeatedly
    <div @hotkey('right').repeat=fastForward>
    ```

* Changed rules for implicit parenthes / calling in tag trees

    Indented code under a tag-tree will no longer be compiled as an invocation.

    ```imba
    <div> data.name
        "something"
    if data.name
        "something"
    ```

    The code above would previously compile to div `data.name("something")`. Now
    indentation in tag trees will behave like they do in statements like if/for/while etc.
    This fixes #630, so you can now add css blocks like this:

    ```imba
    <div> data.name
        css d:block # style for the div
    ```

* Added `@first-child` and `@last-child` css modifiers

    We already have `@first` and `@last` as shorter aliases, but since all other standard pseudo-selectors exist it makes sense to include the longer versions of these as well.

* Fixed issue with nested loops in tag trees

    It is now possible to use nested loops without wrapping the inner loops in a fragment.

    ```imba
    <div>
        for item in data.items
            for label in item.labels
                <div> label
    ```

* Allow declaring variables and global tags with the same name

    Global web components should not be registered as regular variables.
    Previously the compiler would throw an error if `tag app` and `let app = ...`
    were declared in the same file.

* Allow optional chaining with dynamic keys - #638

    ```imba
    user..[key]
    ```

* Mark imported SVGs as @__PURE__

    This allows efficient tree-shaking so that one can include all icons from a collection
    and only bundle the ones that are used.

    ```imba
    import * as icons from 'imba-codicons'
    
    <svg src=icons.volume-up>
    # you get completions and previews for all icons, but only volume-up
    # will be bundled in your code now
    ```

* Don't round x,y in `@touch.reframe` and `@touch.fit` by default (#639)

## 2.0.0-alpha.187

* Call `dehydrate` on compononents when rendering components from the server.

* Updated type declarations.

## 2.0.0-alpha.186

* Don't add html class name for named elements

    Previously when naming an element like `<div$title> ...`, imba would automatically
    add a `title` class name to the element. This can lead to confusing issues. If you
    have used this undocumented behaviour previously you just need to add the class
    yourself, like `<div$title.title>`.

* Introduced `@mouse.mod` modifier

    Since Mac and Windows/Linux use different keyboard modifiers for most standard actions
    (ctrl+c,ctrl+s,ctrl+click) vs (⌘c,⌘s,⌘+click) etc, it makes sense to have an event
    modifier that takes care of checking the platform. `@mouse.mod` will return true of
    ⌘ is pressed on mac, and Ctrl is pressed on all other platforms.
    
    ```imba
    <div @click.mod.stop=openInNewWindow @click=openHere>
    ```
    
* Fixed bug in `@event.throttle` modifier

## 2.0.0-alpha.183

- Remove unneeded class names on tags when building

## 2.0.0-alpha.182

- Fixed issues with using event modifiers with external imba library

## 2.0.0-alpha.177

- Added type declarations into typings/

## 2.0.0-alpha.176

- Deprecated `@touch.moved-dir`
    
    The direction of the `@touch.moved` modifier can now be specified in the second argument of `@touch.moved` instead of as 6 separate modifiers. These are not used that often and it seems natural to keep inside a single modifier instead.
    
    ```imba
    <div @touch.moved-left(4px)> # before
    <div @touch.moved(4px,'left')> # after
    ```

- Renamed style property `tint` to `hue`
    
    Hue is a better name for the newly introduced `tint` style property.
    
    ```imba
    # hue can be set to any named color from the imba color palette
    <div[hue:orange]>
        <h1[color:hue7]> # refer to a shade/tint of the aliased color
    ```

- Refactored event modifiers

    Foundations to allow defining custom event modifiers down the road. Complex modifiers have access to the context in which it was called, including a state-object that is persisted across events etc. Documentation fo this will be in place before 2.0 final. As an example, a tiny `@keydown.f1` modifier for only passing through F1 can be defined like this:
    
    ```imba
    extend class KeyboardEvent
      
      def @f1
        return keyCode == 112
    ```
    
- Changed behavior of `@event.throttle` modifier

    `throttle` would previously fire once and suppress subsequent events for a certain duration (default 250ms). Now it will re-fire at the end of the throttling if there were any suppressed events during the initial throttle. For events like `@resize` and `@scroll` where you just want to limit how often they fire, the new behavior is much more useful.
    
    ```imba
    # handler will be called immediately upon scrolling and keep emitting
    # every 100ms until there are no more scroll events. 
    <div @scroll.throttle(100ms)=handler>
    
    # So, clicking this button twice will trigger once immediately,
    # and then again after 1 second. Previously the second click would
    # never trigger.
    <div @click.throttle(1s)=handler>
    ```
    
- Introduced `@event.cooldown` modifier

    The old `throttle` was renamed to `cooldown`. Ie, if you want subsequent button clicks to be suppressed for `n` time (250ms default) you should now use `cooldown` instead of `throttle`.
    
    ```imba
    # So, clicking this button twice will trigger once immediately, and
    # the next click will be ignored as long as it happens less than a second later
    <div @click.cooldown(1s)=handler>
    ```

- Allow negated event modifiers

    Certain event modifiers are called guards, like `@keydown.enter`, `@click.self` etc. These are modifiers that essentially evaluate to true/false and decides whether to continue handling an event or not. `@click.self` would only trigger if the target of the event is the same as the element to which the `@click` is bound. Now you can include a `!` in front of any such event handler to only continue if the guard is false.
    
    Ie. `<div @click.!shift=...>` would only trigger if shiftKey is _not_ pressed.
    
    ```imba
    #  Only call handler if shiftKey is NOT pressed
    <div @click.!shift=handler>
    
    #  Only call handler if target does NOT match the selector
    <div @click.!sel('.active')=handler>
    ```
  
- Introduced `@mouse.left`, `@mouse.middle`, and `@mouse.right` modifiers
    
    Only trigger if the left,middle, or right mouse button is pressed. Works for all mouse and pointer events, as well as the custom `@touch` event.
    
     ```imba
    #  Only call handler if the middle mouse button was pressed
    <div @click.middle=handler>

    #  Only start touch handling if the right mouse button was pressed
    <div @touch.right=handler>
    ```
    
- Introduced `@intersect.flag` modifier

    The `flag` modifier now works differently for `@intersect` event. It will add a css class to the element when it is intersecting and remove it whenever it is not intersecting.
    
     ```imba
    # the html class showing will be present on div
    # whenever it is intersecting with the viewport
    <div @intersect.flag('showing')>
    ```

- Introduced `@touch.end` modifier

    The `end` guard breaks unless the touch is in its ending state.
    
    ```imba
    # handler is only called at the end of the touch
    <div @touch.end=handler>
    # handler is only called at the end of the touch if pointer moved
    <div @touch.moved.end=handler>
    ```

- Introduced `@touch.hold(dur=1000ms)` modifier
    
    The `hold` modifier allows you to require an element to be pressed for some time (default 1000ms) until it starts allow events to come through.
  
    ```imba
    # handler is only called once the touch has been held for 1000ms
    <div @touch.hold=handler>
    # handler only called if ctrl was pressed and touch held for 250ms
    <div @touch.ctrl.hold(250ms)=handler>
    ```


- Introduced `@touch.apply(target,xprop='x',yprop='y')` modifier

    Like `@touch.sync` but just setting the x,y values on an object directly instead of adding to the previous values. 
    
    ```imba
    const obj = {}
    # apply is essentially shorthand for setting properties:
    <div @touch.apply(obj)>
    <div @touch=(obj.x = e.x, obj.y = e.y)>
    ```


- Added `@event.key(keyOrCode)` modifier for keyboard events

    KeyboardEvent.keyCode is deprecated but still useful in many cases. If you supply a number to the modifier it will stop handling if `keyCode` does not match this number.
    
    ```imba
    # Only trigger if F1 is pressed (event.keyCode==112)
    <div @keydown.key(112)=handler>
    ```
    
    If you supply a string it will compare it against KeyboardEvent.key.
    
    ```imba
    # Only trigger if PrintScreen is pressed (event.key=='PrintScreen')
    <div @keydown.key('PrintScreen')=handler>
    ```

- Changed behavior of `@touch.moved` modifier

    Now, if you add a `moved-left(threshold = 4px)` modifier, the event handling will be cancelled if the touch has moved more in any other direction (in this case up,down, or right) _before_ moving 4px left.
    
    ```imba
    # If user moves more than 10px up/down before left/right
    # the touch will not be handled
    <div @touch.moved-x(10px)=draghandle>
    ```

- Improved behaviour of `@touch` and `@click` events

    `@click` events on nested children of an element with a `@touch` handler would previously be prevented. This made `@touch` pretty challenging to use for things like dragging elements with buttons etc.
    
    Now `@click` events will be triggered unless the `@touch` handler has a `prevent` modifier, a `moved(-x|y|up|down)` modifier that has activated, or a `hold` modifier that has activated.
    
    ```imba
    # button click is triggered onless touch is held more than 500ms
    <li @touch.hold(500ms)=draghandle> <button @click=handle>
    ```

- Improved behaviour of `@touch` and scrolling on touch devices
    Previously, scrolling (and clicking) would be disabled for any element with a `@touch` handler on iOS. Ie. if you added `@touch` to a custom slider, scrolling would not work if the user happened to touch down on the slider while flicking down the page.
    
    Scrolling is disabled by the `prevent` modifier, an activated `moved` modifier or activated `hold` modifier.
    
    ```imba
    # Scrolling will now work fine when touching the div and flicking up/down.
    # Only if the user holds still on the element for 500ms will scrolling and
    # default behavior be prevented.
    <div @touch.hold(500ms)=draghandler>
    ```

  external library - this will no longer work. Ie `window.add-event-listener`
  will not work since `window` does not have an `addΞeventΞlistener` property.
