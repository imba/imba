# imba-ui

This repository is a work in progress. As such, for the time being `imba-ui` is
intended to serve as a source of inspiration for users to see how succinct it
is to create components in Imba. So feel free to either install and use these
components, or jump in to a specific component and look at the code for it.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask on
[Discord](https://imba.io/disc).

Community contributions are very welcome, but since these components should
also serve as illustrative examples to the community, the code should be made
simple and clean.

## Installation

```sh
npm i imba-ui
```

```imba
import 'imba-ui'
```

## Component Documentation

To see the documentation for how to use and customize a specific
component, see the readme in the folder for that component.

If there is no content in a readme, then the code is probably really short.
